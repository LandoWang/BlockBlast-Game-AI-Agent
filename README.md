# Block Blast Game + Reinforcement learning AI agent
This repository is my implementation of the Block Blast game as well as an AI agent that learns how to play BlockBlast using Reinforcement Learning.

### Credits: The game's visual design & assets have been borrowed from https://github.com/Kefrov/Blast/. Everything else, including the game logic, AI agent, etc. have been implemented by me.

Steps:
- [x] Implement the game logic. Make BlockBlast playable by humans.
- [x] Create the game environment for the AI agent.
- [ ] Implement an agent that plays the game randomly.
- [ ] Implement an agent that plays the game using Reinforcement Learning techniques.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies
```bash 
python -m venv blockblast
source blockblast/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. If you want to play the game yourself, run the following command:
```bash
python human_play.py
```
